Always use context7 when I need code generation, planning, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

Check the table in this rule for known library IDs so we can directly get those docs.
Edit the following table as new library-ids become known for this project:

| Library Name | Library ID         |
| :----------- | :----------------- |
| Next.js      | /vercel/next.js    |
| React        | /reactjs/react.dev |
| shadcn       | /shadcn-ui/ui      |
